# EE141 Labs
Credits go to Alexander Serrano and Antonio Ortega from the EE department at the University of Southern California. 

In this repository, some of the concepts presented include simple image processing, traffic flow, page rank, point clouds, Image Transformations and its relation to JPG, eigenfaces, and linear regression.

Many of these labs have other people's names on it, but that is because the instructor wanted the files to be in this specific format.
